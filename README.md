# BiasAnalyzer_Vis_JS
A PyCharm project for bundling BiasAnalyzer javascript files. 

Files that are the javascript files from CohortWidget that have had AnyWidget aspects removed are in the "raw_js" directory.

Files that have been prepared for bundling are in the "src" directory. 

Bundles are in the "dist" directory. <span style="color:red">NOTE: This has not yet been tested with CohortWidget.</span>

Dependencies have not been added to git. If you want to bundle, you'll need to install vite with your npm, then run npm install to get the dependencies.
